Information about the Ouya support for Cocos2d-x example

For this project I use Cocos2d-x version cocos2d-2.1rc0-x-2.1.3. Copy the dropping_2 directory to the following directory:
cocos2d-2.1rc0-x-2.1.3/samples/Cpp. The proj.mac and proj.ouya are the directories I worked in. To compile the Ouya project you will have to edit the build_native.sh file. On the first line the NDK_ROOT is defined. Place the correct path to your android-NDK directory.
